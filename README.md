# sap-abap
My abap project for SAP

This repository represents my personal reusable ABAP code library. Feel free to use or contribute!

Many classes here also represent sample implementations of ABAP design patterns. None of those files include any company-specific functional logic - so there are no "trade secrets" revealed.
