# sap-abap
My abap project for SAP

This repository represents my personal reusable ABAP code library. Feel free to use or contribute!

Many classes here also represent sample implementations of ABAP design patterns. None of those files include any company-specific functional logic - so there are no "trade secrets" revealed.

# How to install

Open the ABAP editor, enter the transaction code SE38/SE37, create a program or function, copy the code into it, and use the shortcut key F8 to run it.

This adaptor works with any ABAP version from 7.0 onwards. I have tested it in 7.31, 7.40 and 7.50, which are the three releases where I can currently maintain it. If you are using any older release please contact me for indications.

This project is tested with BrowserStack
